## Description
You've probably stared at your fair share of little "Loading..." texts and funky [throbbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throbber). Probably far to many and for far too long. It's almost a spiritual experience waiting for the next page to load when you're in a hurry and the network is barely there. Maybe it isn't something loading slow, but outright failing to connect. We've all tried accessing a computer from another computer, and wondering why "Refused to connect" shows up on our screens. Maybe you've run out of options and tried typing in different IPs only for one of them to work, but only sometimes.
So what is it that is actually slow or broken in these scenarios? This talk may enlighten you on the errors of your ways (not rebooting the router).
